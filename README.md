# Perfection_exploit.py
This is a Python script for the Hack The Box Perfection machine that establishes a reverse connection.

Now, this machine has an SSTI attack, which is a server-side template injection.

# what is SSTI Attack
Server-side template injection happens when an attacker uses the template's native syntax to insert a harmful payload, which is then executed on the server.

If you want to read more about SSTI attacks, here's the link:ðŸ‘‰ https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection.

And this is an SSTI payload link if you want to try manually:https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#ruby

# Now this is a target webpage, and the input field named 'Category' is vulnerable to SSTI attacks.ðŸ‘‡

Just run that Python script, but first, put the target IP address and also the attacker's IP and port no to get a reverse connection.
